# to save to github use these commands
# git add .
# git commit -m "added day 1 file"
# git push


# this code will print bye 
# print("bye")

# python3 day_1.py
# print("Hello World!")

# exercise 1 print three seperate lines the same like this
# print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
# print("The function is declared like this:")
# print("print('what to print')")

# print("Hello world!\nHello world!")
# print('print("what to print")')

# This code will print HelloChelsea
# print("Hello" + "Chelsea")
# This code has a space after Hello which will print Hello Chelsea
# print("Hello " + "Chelsea")
# This has a space before Chelea which prints Hello Chelsea
# print("Hello" + " Chelsea")
# This code adds a seperate string for the space
# print("Hello" + " " + "Chelsea")


# exercise 2 debugging
# print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# When double quotes are in the function, single quotes relace where the double quotes usually go
# print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
# print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")


# exercise 3 - Input Function
# this code will print the prompt for the user to respond
# input("What is your name?")
# inserting the input function in to the print function will run the program to respond Hello Chelsea
# print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") )

# len() tells it to print the length of the name input to the prompt
# this code has 3 functions
# print( len( input("What is your name?")))

# notes 
# use thonny.org application to break down the code to understand

# the function is assigned to a variable
# name = input("What is your name?")
# the length function being variable name for short is assigned to this variable
# Length = len(name)
# this code will print whatever function is assigned to the variable in ()
# print(Length)


# excercise 4 - Variables
